Needed librairies:

 - Opengl
 - Bullet physics (make sure libs are installed in /usr/lib and not in /usr/local/lib)

In order to move around:
	- z : forward
	- s : backward
	- q : left
	- d : right
	- a : sprint (hold)

- p is to activate Portal clipping

#### How to compile and run :

`make` to compile
	
`./bin/portal` to launch scene tunnel
`./bin/portal x` to launch scene impossible gate
`./bin/portal x x` to launch scene teleportation
